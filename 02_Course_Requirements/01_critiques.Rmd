The purpose of this assignment is to read and examine critically all sections of a peer-reviewed journal article. As a student of educational research, it is imperative that you gain familiarity and comfort with the structure/purpose of the scientific literature.

For this critique, you will select one quantitative research article published within the last five years in a peer-reviewed  journal. You are free to select any article from any reputable, peer-reviewed journal under the following conditions:

1. The topic of research and theoretical framework are *unrelated* to your planned dissertation research.\footnote{The purpose of forcing you to branch outside of your own topic/theoretical framework is to allow you to, hopefully, experience different approaches to your own planned quantitative methodology. For example, various disciplines use a variety of nomenclature to describe the elements of research methods and design. Assume you have committed to learning how to play classical piano. All you listen to, practice, and perform are arrangements from the classical greats. However, imagine the perspective you might gain by listening to a jazz pianist improvise? The point is to expose you to various ways in which your methodology is implemented in other "genres" of research outside of you own. The more familiar you can be with your methodology now, the better off you will be both during your oral qualifying exam as well as your dissertation proposal presentation.}
2. However, the author(s) utilized quantitative methodology similar to or identical to that of your own planned research, as you currently understand it.
