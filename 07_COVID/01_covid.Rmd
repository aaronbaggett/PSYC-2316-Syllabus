For both semesters of the 2020-2021 academic year, UMHB will utilize three approaches to class offerings:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A hybrid-flexible approach, called CRUflex, will be utilized for most class offerings. CRUflex courses will be set up to run face-to-face, online synchronously, and online asynchronously at the same time. Students will have the choice to attend any or all of these formats each week.
\item Some courses and programs, called non-CRUflex, will be excluded from components of the CRUflex model. Excluded courses may include classes such as clinicals, internships, activity courses, and courses/programs where specific accreditation requirements apply. Non-CRUflex courses will not be able to accommodate all three modalities simultaneously. Thus, there may be a mandatory face-to-face component or restrictions for online participation.
\item Traditional online courses will be offered as well. Online courses do not have an on campus component.
\end{enumerate}


Flexibility is at the heart of this new approach to classroom instruction.  For CRUflex courses, you may opt to do any of the following:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Take a course in a modified face-to-face manner that allows for social distancing
\item Take a course online for the entire semester 
\item Begin the semester remotely and attend face-to-face later in the semester
\item Begin the semester face-to-face and complete the course remotely
\item Choose a combination of modalities to fit your current needs.
\end{enumerate}
 
We will adopt a classroom model that divides most classes into multiple cohorts.  Students will attend classes face-to-face on certain days and remotely at other times.  The amount of time for each modality may be different for each course depending on classroom capacity, number of students in the class, and social distancing requirements.  For the days in which you are not in the classroom, you can attend remotely during the same time as the class or even at a later time.

This hybrid model will go into effect for almost all courses, with accommodations made for some classes such as clinicals, internships, activity courses, and courses/programs where specific accreditation requirements apply.   More information about those courses will be coming to you from your deans.
