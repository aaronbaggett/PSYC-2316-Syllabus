Your culminating assignment/project in EDAD 7312 will be comprised of an abridged, rough sketch version of your dissertation's methods section (chapter 3). In chapter 3, you detail, in a sense, the who, what, when, where, and hows of your particular experiment, study, or project. In the case of a quantitative dissertation, this involves, at minimum:

1. details about your participants,
2. sampling procedures,
3. random assignment methods, (if applicable),
4. any materials used (e.g., instruments, software, questionnaires, etc.),
5. definitions and identification of all variables (e.g., independent vs. dependent; predictor vs. outcome; explanatory vs. response, etc.), and finally,
6. the statistical methods used in order to test hypotheses or make inferences.

I realize this assignment may feel a little daunting for some of you. Not to worry. Again, the more familiar you can be with your methodology now, the better off you will be both during your oral qualifying exam as well as your dissertation proposal presentation. This assignment will help prepare you for Saturday, December 05! *A detailed submission template and grading rubric will be provided*.

Chapter 3 in a Nutshell is due **Saturday, December 05, 2020.**
