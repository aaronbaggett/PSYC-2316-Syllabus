Your regular attendance and participation in this course is expected. I will record and maintain attendance records for each student. Attendance is worth 5\% of your final grade. In other words, if you attend 050\% of the scheduled class meetings you will earn the complete 5\% attendance total. Any University- or otherwise-excused absence will not count toward this total. At the conclusion of the semester, the percentage of class meetings you attended will be multiplied by 0.05 to obtain your attendance grade.
