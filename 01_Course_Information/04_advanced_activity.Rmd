Doctoral courses contain appropriate advanced academic activity reflected in the areas of content, process, and product.  The advanced activity is facilitated through the dimension of critical thinking, synthesis and integration of materials, depth of engagement of materials, and contribution to scholarship.  The purpose of advanced academic activity is to demonstrate a higher level of sophistication and to emphasize separation from masters level courses.
