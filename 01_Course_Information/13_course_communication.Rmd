\subsubsection{Email}
Most all course communication outside of class will take place via email.  I will routinely email you course updates and announcements to your UMHB-assigned email address.  Thus, you should check your email frequently.  Likewise, due to the nature of this class and the corresponding assignments, you will likely need to contact me with questions. I am committed to responding as quickly as possible to your questions via email. As a result, you can expect me to respond, on average, within several hours of your email---often sooner. However, in some circumstances, a personal visit during office hours or other scheduled appointment may be more efficient than email. You are welcome to call me on my office line: (254) 295-4553. This can be an even more efficient method for quick troubleshooting inquiries.

\subsubsection{Remind}
There may be occasions when alerting you to course-related updates may be most effective in real-time. In these situations, I will communicate with you through a free, safe, and one-way  messaging service called Remind.  To sign up for these alerts, text \texttt{@educ7312} to 81010 and follow the instructions.  If you have trouble with this method, try texting \texttt{@educ7312} to (254) 296-8301. Additionally, although not likely, there may be extenuating circumstances which require me to delay and/or cancel a class or other meeting.  

<!-- \subsubsection{Video Conferencing} -->
<!-- Considering the nontraditional format of the Doctor of Education program there may be several occasions on which it may be more effective for the instructor and student(s) to meet between class sessions via video conferencing software. As these instances occur, the instructor will coordinate with the student(s) regarding scheduling and setup logistics. In most instances, however, student meetings for the Fall 2020 semester will occur via Dr. Baggett's personal \texttt{\href{https://umhb.zoom.us/j/5393191651}{Zoom ID}}, unless otherwise noted. -->
