It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to request disability accommodations. Students requesting an accommodation for a disability, must contact the UMHB \href{http://cths.umhb.edu/disability}{\texttt{Counseling, Testing \& Health Services}} as early as possible in the term. \href{http://catalog.umhb.edu/en/2019-2020/Graduate-Catalog}{\texttt{The Course Catalog}}, \href{http://students.umhb.edu/student-handbook}{\texttt{Student Handbook}} and \href{https://go.umhb.edu/}{\texttt{UMHB website}} provide more details regarding the process by which accommodation requests will be reviewed.
